# First TensorFlow Project

I've built a few neural nets by hand: using Octave and also in Python with numpy. And I've also used "canned" routines in both R and Python. And, most recently, I've built slightly more sophisticated networks using Keras (which can be configured to use either Theano or TensorFlow).

While taking Geoff Hinton's Neural Network course, I became interested in using NNs to learn word-embedding vectors. I had a difficult time getting Keras do things like tying weights and merging and splitting tensors. Since I was already curious about TensorFlow, I decided it was time to built a project using it.

This GitHub Project Page summarizes my work:
