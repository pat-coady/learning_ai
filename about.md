title: About Me
---
For 20 years, I designed and developed analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits (ICs) at [Maxim Integrated](https://www.maximintegrated.com/). I started as an IC designer and then led a small design team. Before I knew it, I was engineering director for a large business group with locations around the world. No matter my role, I always enjoyed the challenge of designing complex electronics using only transistors, resistors, and capacitors. It was especially rewarding to see these products manufactured and sold in the tens of millions. I was fortunate to have great mentors and teammates during a very exciting time in the semiconductor industry.

Now I am devoting my energies towards a different field: artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. I am inspired by both the progress and the potential of AI. It is energizing to enter a field where the major breakthroughs are recent, and new applications are around every corner.

To this end, I am taking courses, reading books and journals, and completing small projects. My goal is to build expertise quickly and join a team where I can make a big difference â€“ ideally combining my newly acquired AI expertise with my past electronics engineering experience.
