I’ve had a successful and rewarding career developing high-performance mixed-signal ICs: first as a circuit designer, then as director of engineering and, most recently, leading an advanced R&D team. Now I am devoting my energies towards a different field: artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. I am inspired by both the progress and the potential of these technologies.

Presently, I am taking coursework, reading books and journals, and preparing to participate in AI competitions and challenges. My goal is to build expertise quickly and join a team where I can make a big difference – ideally combining my newly acquired AI expertise with my electronics and engineering experience.
