title: About Me
---
After a rewarding career developing integrated circuits (ICs), I resolved to move into the field of artificial intelligence / machine learning. I am inspired by both the progress and the potential of AI.

My sole focus over the past year has been building expertise in AI through coursework and independent projects. After establishing solid fundamentals, I have completed advanced courses and projects in reinforcement learning, machine vision, NLP, and probabilistic graphical models.

Throughout my career, I have made a significant impact in many different roles. As a circuit designer, I creatively solved tough challenges to bring successful products to market. As a project leader, I led large and diverse teams to develop complex system ICs. Finally, as executive director of engineering, I built and managed a world-class design group for our companyâ€™s new mobile audio business - a business that still thrives today.

I am excited for a similarly impactful career using AI to solve meaningful challenges.
